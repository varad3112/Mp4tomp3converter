 MP4 to MP3 Microservices Converter
Welcome to the MP4 to MP3 Microservices Converter!
This project provides a robust, scalable solution for converting .mp4 video files to .mp3 audio files using a microservices architecture orchestrated with Docker.

✨ Features
Microservices Architecture: Decoupled services for improved scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.

Fully Dockerized: Consistent environments and hassle-free deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.

Asynchronous Processing: Message queue ensures non-blocking, reliable conversion tasks.

Scalable Design: Scale individual services independently based on workload.

RESTful API: Simple, clean endpoints for uploading videos and retrieving converted files.

🚀 Architecture Overview
This converter uses independent microservices that communicate via a message broker for reliable task distribution.

Services Overview:

API Gateway (Flask/FastAPI):

Exposes REST API endpoints.

Accepts .mp4 uploads, submits jobs to the queue, and serves converted files.

Message Queue (RabbitMQ):

Manages communication between services.

Guarantees reliable delivery of conversion tasks.

Conversion Worker (Python + FFmpeg):

Processes jobs from the queue.

Converts .mp4 to .mp3 using FFmpeg.

Saves results to storage.

Storage Service (Local or Cloud):

Manages file storage and retrieval.

Can be a simple Flask app or integrated with AWS S3, GCS, etc.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Docker & Docker Compose — Container orchestration.

Python — Primary language (Flask, FastAPI).

RabbitMQ — Message broker.

FFmpeg — Media conversion tool.

🏁 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites
Docker Desktop — Install Docker Desktop

📂 Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mp4-to-mp3-converter.git
cd mp4-to-mp3-converter
▶️ Run the Application
Start all services with:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
This will:

Build Docker images for each service.

Spin up containers for RabbitMQ, API Gateway, Worker, and Storage.

Stream logs from all services to your terminal.

💡 How to Use
1️⃣ Upload an MP4 File
Send a POST request to /convert with your .mp4 file.

Example (with curl):

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/video.mp4" http://localhost:5000/convert
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "job_id": "your-job-id",
  "status": "queued",
  "message": "Conversion job submitted successfully."
}
2️⃣ Check Job Status
Check the status of a conversion:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:5000/status/your-job-id
Possible responses:

json
Copy
Edit
// Still processing:
{
  "job_id": "your-job-id",
  "status": "processing",
  "message": "Conversion in progress."
}

// Completed:
{
  "job_id": "your-job-id",
  "status": "completed",
  "message": "Conversion completed.",
  "download_url": "http://localhost:5000/download/your-job-id.mp3"
}

// Failed:
{
  "job_id": "your-job-id",
  "status": "failed",
  "message": "Conversion failed. See logs for details."
}

// Not found:
{
  "job_id": "your-job-id",
  "status": "not_found",
  "message": "Job not found."
}
3️⃣ Download the Converted MP3
Once completed, download the .mp3 using the download_url:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -O http://localhost:5000/download/your-job-id.mp3
