# 🎵 MP4 to MP3 Microservices Converter

Welcome to the **MP4 to MP3 Microservices Converter!**  
This project offers a robust, scalable solution for converting `.mp4` video files into `.mp3` audio files using a modern **microservices architecture** orchestrated with **Docker**.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Microservices Architecture** — Decoupled services for better scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance  
✅ **Dockerized** — Consistent environments & easy deployment with Docker & Docker Compose  
✅ **Asynchronous Processing** — Message queue for reliable, non-blocking conversions  
✅ **Scalable** — Scale services independently based on workload  
✅ **RESTful API** — Simple endpoints for uploading videos & retrieving converted audio

---

## 🚀 Architecture Overview

The system uses independent microservices communicating through a **message queue** for robust and reliable task handling.


**Components:**

- **API Gateway (Flask/FastAPI)**  
  Handles file uploads, job submissions, and status checks.

- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ)**  
  Central hub for distributing conversion tasks.

- **Conversion Worker (Python + FFmpeg)**  
  Pulls tasks from the queue, converts `.mp4` to `.mp3`, stores the result.

- **Storage Service (Local/Cloud)**  
  Manages storage & retrieval of files (can integrate with S3, GCS, etc.).
